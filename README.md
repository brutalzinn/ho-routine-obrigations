# Routine obrigations

Lets suppose its 3:00 AM and you cant sleep because you are a critical sensorial disorder. You now this is mandatory that you do some moviments to stabilish yourself.

A sensorial disorder is a random counter effect after a weekend with much improviments and chaos.

But none of you regulatory moviments is affective because you are a hyperfocused at something.

In my case, i am studying theory of conjunctions and apply SQL queries to do somethings with geogebra and postgres database. I cant sleep because my brain is trying to solve problems when i really need a break.

Sometimes the hyperfocus is not handle whell and i lost many energy to manage it.

In this case, its mandatory that the routine has constant points. Without constant points i feel less secure.

# My context

For me, i am using a Home Assistant OS integrated with my Alexa devices around my house. Soo lets suppose its 12:00 AM. At Brazil its the typical time to give a break. But if you are at a hiperfocus  and cant stop by yourself, its considerable dangerius.

When you cant manage the routine like a robot its time to implements some life hacks to be easily-passive-less agressive possible to my own mindless situtation.

# What we can do in this kind of situation? 

Healthcare and medical support its the most important thing at this cases.
 But, if you are like me around you 23 years and has some skills that can solve these small float points, you undestand me.

Now its 23:15 and this simple service with Golang that can receive a Home Assistant web socket connection. Less than 15 minutes the backend is ready. Tomorrgow i will create a small flutter application to read the QR CODE and send to this service.

I will put some qr codes at kitchen, my room and at restroom. At some time, the home assistant will try to alert me to go to these points. I called these points like "obrigations".

OK. OK ITS HARD TO SOLVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM. But.. at this time, i cant handle any breaks. I am very, very, very health critical situation.

# CHANGE LOG

- MQTT OR WEB SOCKET to connection with HO? YES. We dont need mqtt here. Its not just a IoT plataform.
Its overthink project when i suppose to do other things.
